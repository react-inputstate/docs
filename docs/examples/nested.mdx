# Nested inputs example

Here's a more complex example that uses more of the React Nuclear features:

<NestedExampleComponent />

You can check all the values that React Nuclear keeps track of by clicking the üõ†Ô∏è icon next to "Party input".

I've also included a number to the left of each input that shows how many re-renders have happened for that input.

Source:

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
